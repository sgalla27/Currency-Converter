# Currency-Converter

This project was developed by Sean Gallagher, Christian Marinas, and Will Schreyer. This program converts between 6 different currencies using an API that updates conversion rates in real-time. My contribution to this project was editing the index.html file given by the bootstrap template used in order for it to fit our needs. In addition, I added functionality for new text boxes and added new graphics for each currency. Finally, I added functionality for the second page which displays the live conversion rates given by the API.
